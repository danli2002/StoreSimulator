# StoreSimulator
This is a basic game that simulates running a small store. Buy bulk product, sell them at a markup, and earn profit to expand your store! However, nothing lasts forever so you will have to make some changes to your prices and operation to keep up with changing times. If a global pandemic hits, you might want to make some adjustments for toilet paper prices...

# To-do
* Fix some poorly written code (mathematical models and such)
* Add random events (pandemics, disasters, economic crisis)
* ~Finish the financing system (bank loans, credit score, etc.)~ Finished 5/27/20!
* Port everything to an easy to use GUI with jFrame (pretty tough)
