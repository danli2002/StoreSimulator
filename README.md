# Store Simulator by stezhd
This is a basic game that simulates running a small store. Buy bulk product, sell them at a markup, and earn profit to expand your store! However, nothing lasts forever so you will have to make some changes to your prices and operation to keep up with changing times. If a global pandemic hits, you might want to make some adjustments for toilet paper prices...

# How to Run
In your desired directory for the game, open terminal and run:
`git clone https://github.com/stezhd/StoreSimulator`

Make sure that you have the latest version of the Java JDK and that `javac` works properly on your machine.

You're going to want to compile GrocerySim.java with `javac GrocerySim.java` and then simply run it using `java GrocerySim`.

# To-Do
* Fix some poorly written code (mathematical models and such)
* ~Add random events (pandemics, disasters, economic crisis)~ Finished 5/30/20
* ~Finish the financing system (bank loans, credit score, etc.)~ Finished 5/27/20!
* Saveable game data in a txt file
* Port everything to an easy to use GUI with jFrame (pretty tough)
